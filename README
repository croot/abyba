what is this? this is Talisman ver.1 preXP1 source code.
what is XP1? it's eXperience Pack 1 for version 1 (tags\1).
why do we need it? for more bugs feedback. at first, i wished to publish XP1 when it will be completely done. but i'm changed my mind. well... some people WANTED to so it was ;) so, when it will be done - it will be moved to tags\1

how to install:
1)	edit config.list
2)	run pybot.py
3)	from botadmin jid type to bot jid "зайти some_chat@at.some.server"
